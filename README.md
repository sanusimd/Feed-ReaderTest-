## Reference

[2.1 Jasmine documentation](https://jasmine.github.io/2.1/introduction.html)

i used Javascript Testing Framework (Jasmine) testing feeds in the project 
such as 
1. A test that loops through each feed
2.  A test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default under "The Menu" test suite.
3.  A test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked
4.  A test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
5.  Atest that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes. Remember, loadFeed() is asynchronous.
